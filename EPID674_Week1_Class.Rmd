## Programming language: R

This course will introduce the R statistical programming language for
epidemiologic analyses. R statistical software is a freely available,
versatile, and powerful program for statistical computing and graphics
(<https://www.r-project.org/>). A helpful interface for R is provided by
RStudio (<http://www.rstudio.com/>). For a shared educational
environment in this class, we will use the online version of R and
RStudio called RStudio Cloud (<https://rstudio.cloud/>).

## Authoring Software: RMarkdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting
programming language for authoring HTML, PDF, and Microsoft Word
documents. For more details on using R Markdown see
<http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document.

You can embed an R code chunk like this: Here we load the `knitr`
package into our current R session to make useful functions available.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Chapter 1, Getting Started with R

## Explaining commands/output

An R command (we'll also call it code or a code chunk) will be grey and
look like this. The text in this section will be talking to R.

```{r code}
print("I'm code")
```

Directly after the code chunk will be the output of the code.
So `print("I'm code")` is the code chunk and [1] "I'm code" is the
output.

## R as a calculator

The R console is a full calculator Try to play around with it: +, -, /,
* are add, subtract, divide and multiply ^ or ** is power
parentheses -- ( and ) -- work with order of operations

```{r calculator_demo}
2 + 2
2 * 4
2 ^ 3

2 + (2 * 3)^2
(1 + 3) / 2 + 45
```

Note, when you type your command, R inherently thinks you want to print
the result.

Test your comprehension: Make an R code chunk and try evaluating the
following: 2 + 2 \* 3 / 4 -3 2 \* 3 / 4 \* 2 2\^4 - 1

## Commenting in Scripts

`#` is the comment symbol in R

```{r comments}
# Comments in R follow the hashtag symbol
# Anything from the # to the end of the line (on the right) will be ignored by R. Note the color of your code changes after you use a hashtag

# This # is still a comment
### You can use many #'s as you want
1 + 2 # Can be the right of code

# Best practice is to take a ton of notes to help your future self and anyone who comes later to re-run your code
```


## Make your first R objects
* You can create variables from within the R environment and from files on your computer
* R uses "<-"or "=" to assign values to a variable name
* Variable names are case-sensitive, i.e. X and x are different
```{r make_objects}
x <- 4 # x is assigned the value of 4. # Same as: x = 4
x # See what x is
y <- 7 # y is assigned the value of 7
x + y # See what x+y is
z <- x * (x + y) # z is assigned the value of x*(x+y)
z # See what z is
```

# Perform some calculations with 'x' and observe the results
You can perform functions on entire vectors of numbers very easily.
```{r calculations_vector}
x + 4
x - 3
x * 7
x / 10
x * x
x^2
x / x
x == x
```

# Assign a vector of integers from 1 to 4 to the object x, using multiple different functions
* Here we introduce "1 dimensional" classes; often referred to as
    'vectors'
* The function `c()` collects/combines/joins single R objects into a
    vector of R objects. It is mostly used for creating vectors of
    numbers, character strings, and other data types.
* The function `length()`: Get or set the length of vectors (including
    lists) and factors, and of any other R object for which a method has
    been defined.
```{r make_integer_vector}
x <- 1:4 # This writes over the previous x object. No warning or error messages!
x
length(x) # length is a function for checking how long an object is
x <- seq(from = 1, to = 4, by = 1) # Create a vector counting from 1 to 4 by 1
x
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4) # Combine elements into a vector
x
x <- c(2, 3, 4, 1)
x
length(x)
y <- rep(7, times = 4) # Create a vector with four 7's by rep() and assign it to y
y
```

# Make a character vector
```{r make_character_vector}
z <- c("UM", "SPH", "EPI", "Kelly")
z <- c("University of Michigan", "School of Public Health", "Epidemiology", "John Snow")
z
```

## R variable classes
* Vectors can have multiple sets of observations, but each observation
    has to be the same class.
```{r vector_class}
class(x)
class(z)
```

## Use the help viewer
Any time I use a new function, I navigate to the lower right panel and
search for the function. This describes the purpose of the function, the
default settings, and the options you can change.
```{r get_help}
# Another option is to use the 'help' function to search. Look in the lower right panel and the same view will appear.
help(class)
```

# What are the differences between ( ) and [ ] ?
```{r indexing_vector}
length(z) # Rounded parentheses are for functions
z[3] # Square brackets are for looking in objects, this is also called "indexing"
z[2] # Find value based on position
z[1:3]

# Find positions meeting criteria
x < 3 # Provides True/False for whether meets the criteria
which(x < 3) # Finds the positions of the Trues

# Find values meeting criteria
x[x < 3]
```

# Specify options in a function
```{r options_in_a_function}
seq(from = 10, to = 23, by = 1) # count from 10 to 23 by 1
seq(from = 10, to = 23) # equivalent
seq(10, 23) # equivalent
seq(10, -3) # count from 10 to -3
seq(from = -1, to = 11, by = 3) # count from -1 to 11 by 3

# Note, you have all of the tools to complete homework 1
```

# Make your first data frame
* The most comfortable and familiar class/data type for many of you
    will be `data.frame`
* You can think of these as essentially Excel spreadsheets with rows
    (usually subjects or observations) and columns (usually variables)
```{r data_frame}
# Combine x and y vectors by column into a data frame and assign it to an object called 'df'
df <- data.frame(x, y, z)
df # Look at df
df$x # Use $ to call up columns within data frames
df$y
```

# Index (look around) inside the data frame based on the position
```{r indexing_data_frame}
#Index based on position
df[3, 1] # structure: df[rows,columns]
df[4, ]
df[, 1]
df[c(1, 2, 3), ] # Read your R code from the inside out. Start with the innermost set of parentheses.
df[c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE), ]

#Index based on value
df$x>2 #Find a logical vector (True/False) of the rows that meet the value of interest (in this case x>2)
df[, 1] > 2 #Same as above
which(df[,1]>2) #Find rows that meet the criteria, similar to line above

df[df$x>2,] #Now show the rows that are True
df[df[, 1] > 2, ]  #Same as above
```


# Perform calculations on the data frame

```{r calculations_data_frame}
sum(df[, 1])
sum(x)
```

# Recode a value in the data frame based on the position
```{r recode}
df
df[3, 2] <- 5 # recode a value
# What do you expect?
df # What do you get?
# Do they match?
```

## Common new R users frustrations

1.  Different versions of software
    -   RStudio Cloud solves this
2.  Working directory problems: trying to read files that R "can't find"
    -   RStudio Cloud solves this and so does RStudio Projects
3.  Data type problems (is that a character or a numeric object?)
    -   discussed throughout
4.  Typos (R is **case sensitive**, `x` and `X` are different)
    -   RStudio helps with "tab completion"
    -   discussed throughout
5.  R often does not include any error/warning messages. Need to train
    yourself in the following sequence:
     1)  What do I expect?
     2)  What do I get?
     3)  Do they match?

# Remember to save your R script!

# To exit R

```{r exit, eval=FALSE}
q()
```
